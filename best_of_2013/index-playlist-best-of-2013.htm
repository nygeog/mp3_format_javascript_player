    This years' collection may be downloaded or played in the javascript-based player above. Each of these last few years, I consider whether to distribute the songs as .mp3. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MP3">.mp3</a> is not truly open, such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ogg">.ogg</a>, and is not nearly the best file format when considering sound quality (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flac">.flac</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.wav">.wav</a>). Yet, .mp3 still rules the web and our devices. In searching for new or possibly overlooked music released early 2013/late 2013, I've listened to well over 1,000 songs for 2013 this year. It seems like a lot of artists are making albums that have many songs that have more in common than are different. So it seemed much harder to listen to the entirety of many of the albums released this year in single sittings. Simply put,  many artists are trying to use the same sonic palette for most of their songs creating albums that seem uniform rather than adventurous or interesting. Uniformity is safer than garishness or gaudyness. Enough criticism. What is worth praising this year in music? Diversity of range of artists' styles and ensuing sounds that have been released is truly astonishing. Even the potentially dreaded pop music is extremely interesting this year. Compare music from early 2000's, specifically consider the horrid Madonna cover of Don McLane's 'American Pie.' Then consider Lorde, Haim, Drake, etc. The depth of color in the sonic palette is seemingly limitless. From lo-fi rustic bit-crushed sounds to the lushness of pop and r and b, 2013 was an exciting year of sound. In addition, the artists are less tethered to record companies' and sonic expectations than ever before. Though not making the cut this year, MIA had much difficulty with her record company, as much so as to threaten to personally leak it. Physical distribution is no longer required. That said, some of the things to wait and see how they develop revolve around streaming music. First off, <a href="http://exclaim.ca/News/digital_music_streaming_may_be_as_bad_for_environment_as_cds_report">streaming is not 'environmentally-friendly'</a> (so long as you listen to the track more than once that is). Downloading music has less energy use than constantly streaming. In addition, the artists' share of the <a href="http://www.sopitas.com/site/253083-entrevista-con-thom-yorke-de-atoms-for-peace/">pay from streaming their music via Spotify has come under fire, specifically, from Thom Yorke of Radiohead</a>. Now it is entirely possible that streaming music may be the future, and compared to the alternative of no one ever paying for music (cough, cough), mediums like Spotify may restructure their payment plans to be more enticing to artists. But be warned, Spotify is a service, so when you are done paying the monthly fee, you own nothing.
